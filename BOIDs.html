                <h2>Tens of Thousands of BOIDs</h2>
                <p>In order to get more familiar with Compute Shaders in Unity, I made a BOID simulation using the many threads of a Compute Shader in Unity. 
                    BOIDs are agents with flocking behavior and can appear like a swarm of fish or birds. By leveraging the power of the GPU about I could simulate 
                    about 32 thousand BOIDs in Unity with decent performance.

                <h2>BOIDs</h2>
                <p>The BOIDs work by following a few simple rules. They avoid nearby BOIDs, move toward the center of the flock, and try to match velocities 
                    with other nearby BOIDs. I included a box to act as bounds that they would avoid and get teleported to the other side should they 
                    cross it.

                <h2>BOID Castes</h2>
                <p>
                    I made a special BOID that was marked so that it would behave differently and the others would treat it differently. My idea was a 
                    “Smelly BOID” that the others would avoid much more strongly, but it would feel lonely and muscle to the swarm's center. To make it 
                    more distinguished, I made it huge and green with the old high-poly mesh. Thanks to some optimizations I made, I was also able to have 
                    twice as many BOIDs.

                <h2>Optimization</h2>
                <p>
                    In my second simulation, I made some changes so they would run a little quicker, short-circuiting and avoiding costly square roots 
                    whenever possible. The mesh was reduced to a triangular pyramid, substantially reducing the number of triangles. I also got 
                    rid of the teleporting to the other side because that was upsetting the swarm in a weird and seemingly unnatural way.
