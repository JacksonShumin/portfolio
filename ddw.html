                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>This game was made to teach people diversity awareness focusing on the daily struggles of the Deaf community. This game is based on the 
                    real-life activity “Deaf Deaf World” where a mock city is simulated with a single rule: no verbal communication is allowed. We took 
                    this concept and made a series of educational minigames in the colorful space of Deaf Deaf World!</p>

                <h2>What I did</h2>
                <p>I took on the role of Aesthetics Lead and made important decisions about the look of our game. This included finding and creating 3D 
                    assets we would use on the project to maintain a good style throughout the game's levels. I personally build several of the game's 
                    levels including the interior 3D environments for the mini-games. I also built several of the 3D assets in the game from scratch 
                    including the entry archway and all the signs for the buildings. </p>

                <p>I was involved in many of the technical aspects of the game as well. With only 5 people on our team it was essential to take on several 
                    roles to fit the team’s needs. I made the first person controller and the game logic behind the Travel Agency mini-game. NPC dialogue 
                    and player onboarding was another set of tasks that I worked on in collaboration with my teammates. </p>
